## Hi there 👋

Hello, I'm Kristina (previously Liu) Liang! I'm a scientist currently pursuing training in Data Science. 

### My Github profile is currently getting a facelift (adding projects from masters in Biomedical Imaging, MLOps of Data Science projects etc.) 
Please check back around the end of April 2025 after I finish the Data Science Bootcamp from Constructor Academy
